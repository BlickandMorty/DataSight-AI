# Contributing

if you want to help, here is the simple flow:

- open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- fork the repo and submit a pull request
- add or update tests for new behavior

code style:
- keep it simple
- use clear names
- add comments only when the code would be confusing without them

questions:
open an issue and we will take a look.
